Change moderate users --> power users of typeracer - (2.5k to 3k races, >500 texts)
	- Current power users of typeracer may be just better at learning/improving at typing

How does typeracer improve typing speeds?
- First look at span of races
	- Mention how this does not include time breaks between racers or account overall time
- Second look at longest hiatuses for racers
	- Compare to end estimated word per minute
	- Look for "long" hiatuses, remove users

Where to put data wrangling into our setup?
- First filter for racers by typeracerdata
- Then query data for each user directly from typeracer api

Probably improving due to these exercises



- Refactor background, intro to be more generalized towards context for the question
- Refactor question of interest
	- Clarify how this is a causational relationship
	- Assumption about our question of interest (Hypothesis)
- Explain definition of power users and sample of interest, potential assumptions here
- Move context about data setup into other section, explain how data is wrangled in this section
- Experimental assumptions about the data  (good daata), data analysis to clean up data
	- Look at hiatuses
- Actual regression for each user logic and explanation (t_races)
- Results - does it improve typing? how much does it improve typing?
- Conclusion - drawn for power racers of typeracer
