## Questions of Interest
- Research questions which may be supported or refuted by data analysis
  - Predicts or proposes relationships between some variables in study
- Answer a limited number of questions from one or more source
- Focus on a few focused questions

For racers who have played a moderate number of games:
- How do typing races affect/correlate to typing speed?
  - How do typing races affect/correlate to accuracy?
  - How does time spent on typing software affect/correlate to typing speed improvement?
- How does length of text affect typing speed?
  - How does length of text affect accuracy?
  
To make these questions more specific, we can filter racers first by total texts typed and races made to get a "better" sample to answer these questions.  

In the project draft, we will zone in on a specific set of players to analyze. 

If we have more time, we can also analyze the below question:
How do the total number of races affect the total typing speed improvement?

## Data Source(s)
[typeracer stats](https://typeracer.com)
See [here](https://github.com/e6f4e37l/TypeRacerStats/blob/main/TypeRacerStats/Core/Common/urls.py) for lots of potential endpoints

#### Some main endpoints of interest:
- https://typeracerdata.com/leaders?min_races=2500&min_texts=1000&sort=wpm_textbests&rank_start=6000&rank_end=6498
- https://data.typeracer.com/games?playerId=tr:cheffray&n=2500

The first will allow us to find sample users, and the other will allow us to search all races of an individual user.  

## Data Description
- Who collected the data?
  - [typeracer](https://typeracer.com) collects the data, along with the third party, [typeracerdata](https://typeracerdata.com))
- How is data collected?
  - TY: After every match, a race is logged for each racer on the track for the text.
  - TYD: Users can query their name, queried names will then have their data retrieved and agrgegated
  - Typeracer likely collected data to keep track of potentially because of player behavior or their own anlysis
  - Typeracerdata's data was manually queried from players, so data was aggregated there in the interest of those typeracers
- What are key variables in data set and what do they measure? **how do they relate to key questions?**
  - TYD: Racer - The name of the racer to be pulled
  - TY:
    - wpm - Words per minute on text (related to typing speed)
    - ac - Accuracy on text (related to accuracy)
    - t - timestamp of race (related to duration of racing)
    - tid - text id
    - gn - game number (Standardizing game numbers)
    - pts - points = words/sec * words in text (related to length of text)
- If data is sample of large population, what is larger population?
  - We have access to all typeracers logged in typeracerdata, which is a sample of the larger typeracer population
  - For data analysis, we will be using a sample of the typeracerdata racers

## Planned Methods
##### For questions that determine typing speed (and other similar ones)
- Find a filtered sample of players, for each player:
  - Regression model on wpm over all races by other variable of interest
  - Get slope of wpm improvement on each player
- Get mean, standard deviation of all player samples
- Test against hypothesis of no wpm improvement
  - Confidence interval with p-value determining if there is significant improvement or not

This sequence can be repeated for accuracy and points

##### For length-related tests
- Find a filtered sample of players, for each player:
  - Calculate text length from points for each race
  - Regression model on length over all races by other variable of interest
  - Same process as listed above with wpm

## Key Graph(s)
##### How do typing races affect/correlate to typing speed?
- WPM/AC improvement % for each player, aggregated into boxplot OR
- Look at start/end estimated wpm/ac based on regression model point graph OR
- Graph showing wpm improvement density

## Possible Model
- Description of possible model as well as methods of inference or prediction
- Linear model for regression
- Probability/density model for confidence interval testing
